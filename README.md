wisdom for the ages

1. The person who cares less controls the relationship
2. Authority figures always lie for their benefit
3. Official denials are official confirmations (reassurances that "XXX is valued [and not devalued, at risk]" count here as does "We have no evidence" since it just as often means "we did not or cannot look for evidence")
4. Use caution when trusting people who agree with you because you are not testing their beliefs
5. Public accusations are a tacit admission of your own inclinations
6. Time kills all deals
7. Repetition makes lies seem true (neurons that fire together wire together) even if one consciously "knows" it's a lie
8. People as a rule don’t deal with changing feelings. Relationships fade no matter how close they are; your best friend may not even talk to you except when you accidentally encounter one another after a few years.
9. Personality may matter but looks matter first and more
10. "This is the first incident" is only true because the incident is very carefully being defined to be unique.
11. You will not ever feel like doing it (motivation comes and goes - it is fleeting and less effective than habits and discipline; Stephen King's quote “Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work” applies)
12. Always ask doctors or lawyers "what would YOU do?" instead of "what should I do?"; they don't know YOUR situation and constraints but they can explain their constraints.
13. The statistics apply to you, too.  e.g., E=PV.  
14. No matter how well meaning you may be, or how obvious the situation is, except for disclosing what is patently obvious (what you are doing, visibly, at the time, why you are some place in that moment) and what is required of you (name, driver's license when driving), don't talk to the police.  "I am exercising my sixth amendment right to counsel and will not answer questions without my attorney being present."
15. People undervalue that which comes to them easily.  Trying to ease someone's way in career, relationships, friendships, money, etc. will often just lead to that help making their situation worse.
16. No action, however innocuous or inconsequential, will not cause a set of crazies to emerge with conspiracy theories.
17. The most cost-effective and least-effort-intensive way to prove merit is by leaving. Employers have trouble re-evaluating people, especially individual contributors, but exiting to somewhere better means that either they re-evaluate you, or they don't, but it no longer matters.
18. Never, ever rely on an addict.

1. Sudden, forceful, detailed denials without lag tend to indicate the assertions that triggered them are correct[1]
