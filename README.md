wisdom for the ages

1. **The person who cares less controls the relationship.**
2. **Authority figures always lie for their benefit.**
3. **Official denials are official confirmations.** Reassurances that “XXX is valued [and not devalued, at risk]” count here, as does “We have no evidence”; the latter just as often means “we did not or cannot look for evidence”.
4. **Use caution when trusting people who agree with you.** Their affirmation of your beliefs primes you to, in turn, accept their beliefs without questioning them.
5. **Public accusations are a tacit admission of your own inclinations.**
6. **Time kills all deals.**
7. **Repetition makes lies seem true.** Neurons that fire together wire together, even if one consciously “knows” that the statement is a lie.
8. **Relationships fade no matter how close they are.** In a few years, your current best friend may talk to you only in the course of accidental encounters. People don’t deal with changing feelings.
9. **Personality may matter; looks matter first, and more.**
10. **"This is the first incident" is only true because the incident is very carefully being defined to be unique.**
11. **You will not ever feel like doing it.** Motivation comes and goes: it is fleeting and less effective than habits and discipline; Stephen King’s quote, “Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work”, applies.
12. **Always ask doctors or lawyers what *they* would do, not what you should do.** They don’t know *your* situation or constraints, but they can explain theirs.
13. **The statistics apply to you, too.**  e.g., E=PV.  
14. **Beyond disclosing what is either required or *patently* obvious, don’t talk to the police.** No matter how well-meaning you may be, or how obvious the situation is, limit yourself to providing items like your driver's license when driving, along with facts like your name, a description of what you are doing — visibly — at the time, and why you are some place in that moment. Otherwise, stick to “I am exercising my sixth amendment right to counsel, and will not answer questions without my attorney being present.”
