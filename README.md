wisdom for the ages

1. The person who cares less controls the relationship
2. Authority figures always lie for their benefit
3. Official denials are official confirmations (reassurances that "XXX is valued [and not devalued, at risk]" count here)
4. Use caution when trusting people who agree with you because you are not testing their beliefs
5. Public accusations are a tacit admission of your own inclinations
6. Time kills all deals
7. Repetition makes lies seem true (neurons that fire together wire together) even if one consciously "knows" it's a lie
8. Relationships fade no matter how close they are; your best friend may not even talk to you more than when you accidentally encounter one another in a few years. People don’t deal with changing feelings.
9. Personality may matter but looks matter first and more
10. "This is the first incident" is only true because the incident is very carefully being defined to be unique.
11. "We have no evidence" just as often means "we did not or cannot look for evidence"
12. You will not ever feel like doing it
13. Always ask doctors or lawyers "what would YOU do?" instead of "what should I do?"; they don't know YOUR situation and constraints but they can explain their constraints.
14. The statistics apply to you, too.  e.g., E=PV.  
15. No matter how well meaning you may be, or how obvious the situation is, except for disclosing what is patently obvious (what you are doing, visibly, at the time, why you are some place in that moment) and what is required of you (name, driver's license when driving), don't talk to the police.  "I am exercising my sixth amendment right to counsel and will not answer questions without my attorney being present."
