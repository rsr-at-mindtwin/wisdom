minor things I have learned

1. The person who cares less controls the relationship
2. Authority figures always lie for their benefit
3. Official denials are official confirmations (reassurances that "XXX is valued [and not devalued, at risk]" count here as does "We have no evidence" since it just as often means "we did not or cannot look for evidence") [11]
4. Use caution when trusting people who agree with you because you are not testing their beliefs [3] [9]
5. Public accusations are a tacit admission of your own inclinations
6. Time kills all deals [4]
7. Repetition makes lies seem true (neurons that fire together wire together) even if one consciously "knows" it's a lie
8. People as a rule don’t deal with changing feelings. Relationships fade no matter how close they are; your best friend may not even talk to you except when you accidentally encounter one another after a few years.
9. Personality may matter but looks matter first and more [2] 
10. "This is the first incident" is only true because the incident is very carefully being defined to be unique.
11. You will not ever feel like doing it (motivation comes and goes - it is fleeting and less effective than habits and discipline; Stephen King's quote “Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work” applies)
12. Always ask doctors, lawyers and other experts, "what would YOU do?" instead of "what should I do?"; there is a cognitive bias when people evaluate the situation of others, they are unaware of constraints and other considerations, but when thinking about the situation as their own, constraints are brought to the forefront and they also gain better ability to explain the logic of their feedback.
13. The statistics apply to you, too.  e.g., E=PV.  
14. No matter how well meaning you may be, or how obvious the situation is, except for disclosing what is patently obvious (what you are doing, visibly, at the time, why you are some place in that moment) and what is required of you (name, driver's license when driving), don't talk to the police.  "I am exercising my sixth amendment right to counsel and will not answer questions without my attorney being present."
15. People undervalue that which comes to them easily.  Trying to ease someone's way in career, relationships, friendships, money, etc. will often just lead to that help making their situation worse.
16. No action, however innocuous or inconsequential, will not cause a set of crazies to emerge with conspiracy theories.
17. The most cost-effective and least-effort-intensive way to prove merit is by leaving. Employers have trouble re-evaluating people, especially individual contributors, but exiting to somewhere better means that either they re-evaluate you, or they don't, but it no longer matters.
18. Never, ever rely on an addict.
19. All sentences, in all languages, implicitly end with the phrase "for now."
20. If you see an advertisement, story, essay, etc. in any media, especially online media, even if it appears to be aimed at a different demographic, it's actually there for *you*, specifically, to manipulate you. [5]
21. Be aware that skill at detecting manipulative people actually ends up selecting for a higher class of skilled liars - you will believe the one who fools you. [6]
22. It's not a tribe unless you have the ability to ask the tribe to give back.[7]
23. The most reliable predictor of future behavior is past behavior.
24. Insiders compete with insiders so they spend most of their effort building things for insiders.[8]
25. There's nothing magical about situational awareness.  Awareness of where you are at can be neutral, positive or negative. [10]
26. Everything you see in the media is trying to sell you something.
27. When the good people go, *go with them*. [12] 
28. Once people realize they are doomed - that is, their situation is such that they perceive they will be in a bad position no matter what they do - they also realize that authorities can no longer punish them and they become very dangerous. [14]
 
Adjacent:

1. Sudden, forceful, detailed denials without lag tend to indicate the assertions that triggered them are correct[1]
2. A conflict-avoidant personality type in a leadership position can only lead to ruin.
3. At some point, your best case scenario and your worst case scenario basically will blend together. [13]
4. Nihilism as a fallback position when confronted with a moral assertion is a dodge.
 
Footnotes:

[1] example - "Most companies will at least take 20 minutes to run the placeholder press release by legal. Milton did not pass go on this one, so yea, this is probably the record for vehement and ad hominem denials cc: HindenbergRes $NKLA" https://twitter.com/muddywatersre/status/1304051845111844864 

[2] It doesn't matter if the importance fades. Things that function as gatekeepers have primacy. First impressions matter.

[3] "It is better to fall in with crows than with flatterers; for in the one case you are devoured when dead, in the other case while alive." 	Antisthenes (Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 4)

[4] this is common wisdom among people who have been in sales; it's a stronger assertion than its complement, which is that interested customers will just get the buying over with and if a deal is taking too long, they were never really going to buy. the assertion here is that without inertia and energy, no deal will get done, and both of those inherently fade, no matter what.

[5] the essay at the defunct site "The Last Psychiatrist" talks about this with regard to branding and advertising, but it's a universal rule -  https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/11/luxury_branding_the_future_lea.html ; the relentless ingroup branding and view-reaffirmation of sites like The Washington Post (which I read regularly) is no different than your run of the mill crazy conspiracy site. Once you recognize how ugly, manupulative and mean-spirited it is, especially because it naturally appeals to people like me in the in-group, it's kind of hard to get past.

[6] Back when we were hiring a CEO, I spent time fretting about the issue that I was effectively a selection function for skilled liars/manupulators, a trait for which the people in the candidate pool are known (with good reason). There’s a problem in that context, though, which is that on some level the limit of liar is successful "reality distortion field"-type CEO.  The kind that screwed over his cofounders and even his own child but was one of the most successful CEOs in history might be a better choice than that nice non-psychopath that just doesn't get you there. The huge middle ground is the problem: scheming and self-serving, yes, but also ineffective. Anyway, an element of randomness can be used to help manage skilled liars.

[7] Put another way, the fake team membership (team Xbox vs. team PS3, "home team" sports teams, etc.) is just a kind of fantasizing of membership that people fall into. In reality, you are not on anyone's "side" or "team" if there isn't some kind of real reciprocal relationship.  Or, tersely, don't love something that can't or won't love you back and may not even know you exist. hat tip: danM

	a lesson I’ve learned by @nntaleb is that journalists write to impress other journalists. 
	Architects to impress other architects.
	The gym equivalent of this is bodybuilding.
	Instead of building body for life, we now build bodies to impress others that build bodies

[9] An interesting, related, and perhaps even true anecdote I came across - https://www.viewofchina.com/fan-zhongyan/ Fan Zhongyan:  

	I heard Confucian knew how to keep a distance from cunning men, as those are not the people the sage would like to work with. 
	They have no concern for the nation, hold no vision for the future, but relentlessly pursue their personal interest, and chase after fame and wealth. 
	They would say what their boss likes to hear, desire what their boss fancies to obtain, praise what their boss wishes to honour and censure what their boss wants to condemn … 
	by so doing, they win trust from their boss to the point that they get a free hand to conduct their own wretched business.  

	When these people gain access to power, the country will either be in trouble or meet a doomed fate.  

	Fortunately, there is an easy way to identify such creatures. 

	*If someone is forever agreeable with you and help you to screen out opinions that you don’t like to hear, there can be little doubt that this person must be a sinister schemer.*
	
[10] Tracking the days you have left in your expected lifespan (see #13 if your response is "but I {am a vegan, exercise, have good genes, ...}!") can be extremely motivating as you get older, but as a young man it was meaningless to me.  Now, each year is 2.5+% of my remaining left and 4+% of my remaining "health span"; the same observation was once an observation that I had plenty of time and shouldn't worry, then gradually became the observation that it was time to get serious, and has evolved into the present day observation that I don't have time to waste.

[11] "Omnis determinatio est negatio" = Every determination is a negation - an interesting adhacent rule: official assertions are unofficial admissions of the opposite.  See: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/hegel-bulletin/article/abs/determination-is-negation-the-adventures-of-a-doctrine-from-spinoza-to-hegel-to-the-british-idealists/80AF0919E86130F800FDB2A127AD862D ("‘Determination is negation’: The Adventures of a Doctrine from Spinoza to Hegel to the British Idealists") or, hell, https://twitter.com/kamilkazani/status/1496535331260321801?s=21 ; this is different from the interpretation "Every determination gives rise to a contradiction" and is more a direct contrast to rule 3. once again hat tip: danM

[12] this has been my mantra for at least 22 years and I honestly can't remember where I picked it up nor believe that I forgot to list it here. 

[13] As you age, you will almost certainly experience periods where the best case outcome for your current situation is not materially better or more palatable than your worst case outcome. When you are very, very old this will become true - death or another day? I've had people directly tell me they would be happier if death would finally come, not because they're sad or whatever, but they're just done, and another day trapped at age 95 with failing vision, etc. and mostly living in memories of the past is indistinguishable to them from not-another-day.  More generally, a lot of people find themselves in this kind of death-like-stasis when they've allowed themselves to get stale.  These are those moments where you ask yourself - what's the worst case? I get fired? Or is it actually worse to not do whatever it is and *not* ot get fired and continue to be bored our of their mind and trapped by inertia? They wonder, "is it maybe better to just get fired or passed over or whatever and no longer endure it?" When you've been in the wrong role or position too long, all of these cases just blend together and it is not even possible to even tell which path would be better or worse. People in this situation are well advised to shake things up and challenge themselves again - move on, in whatever form.

[14] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Sheng - "Chen Sheng was born in Yangcheng (陽城; in present-day Fangcheng County, Henan). In 209 BC, he was a military captain along with Wu Guang when the two of them were ordered to lead 900 soldiers to Yuyang (漁陽; southwest of present-day Miyun County, Beijing) to help defend the northern border against Xiongnu. Due to storms, it became clear that they could not get to Yuyang by the deadline, and according to law, if soldiers could not get to their posts on time, they would be executed. Chen Sheng and Wu Guang, believing that they were doomed, led their soldiers to start a rebellion." - Well, if I'm going to be executed anyway, ...
